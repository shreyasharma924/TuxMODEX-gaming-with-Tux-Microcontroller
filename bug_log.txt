BUG LOG 

1. Bug no:1 
- Bug Description:
    The characters displayed on the status bar where showing up as dots in the status bar (but looked really similar to the letters) instead of 
    proper letters when I tried to input "hello". 

- Ecpected Behavior: 
    The string being displayed norrmal and aligned within the space of the status bar

- Actual Bhavior: 
    Dots in the status bar - but resembled the actual letters  

-Fix: 
    The way I set up my buffer was incorrect, specifically the way I mapped the planes. Made it much less complicated by then adding one line to text.c 
    instead of using another 50 lines of code in show_status_bar (line 624 in text.c). The way I fixed it is by visualizing the planes specifically in 
    the order of 0,1,2,3 . Initally what I had in the line was just 320+(i*8)+(j*320), but through this I realised I did not map anything to the 
    planes and simply just calculated the offset. I mapped the exact plane by using %4, and found the right comlumns offset by /4. 

-Time: 2-3 hours  


2. Bug no:2
- Bug Description:
    Tried to display my status message on the screen but nothing would appear 

- Ecpected Behavior: 
    Upong going in the wrong track or clicking enter, a status message is suppose to appear (at different times than the room name)

- Actual Bhavior: 
    Status message would not appear, only the room name would appear on the screeen 

-Fix: 
   Initailly I would check for a status message by checking it was not NULL (I also tried to use '/0' but that did not see to work either), instead I used ==0. 
   This allowed my status message to be recognized and then I would set the value of ca = 0 and pass it to the prnt_text function for the
   message to be printed (line 558 in modex.c)

-Time: 30 mins   


3. Bug no:3
- Bug Description:
    Tried to display my status message on the screen but it would be over written with my room name 

- Ecpected Behavior: 
    It should be displayed seperately at different times and not at the exact same location

- Actual Bhavior: 
    Both the names would just overlap with each other so the text desplayed would not be recognized 

-Fix: 
   added a seperate parameter in print_text  (somewhat like the functionality of a flag), which tells if a status is being displayed or a room name. Depending on that 
   string_to_print is calculated and then parsed throught the graphic to printing part of the function (where its mapped too the planes - which is the 
   same in either case) - (line 606 in text.c)

-Time: 20 mins   


4. Bug no:4
- Bug Description:
    Once I got the status and room name to not overwite anymore, I faced an issue in the calculation of the mid_offset 

- Ecpected Behavior: 
    The status muessage is suppose to display at the middle of the screen 

- Actual Bhavior: 
    Started wrapping around the screen instead (was shfted all the way to the righ and contined in the left part of the screen)

-Fix: 
   Fixed this by recalculating the offset. Initailly I was dividing the whole offset by 8 (4*2) besuase I was accounting for the planes and looking at the middle of the screen.
   But eventually I realized that its just (40-len). Since I had to multiply by 8 as each letter occupies 8 bits of space (line 584 in text.c)

-Time: 30 mins    
  

5. Bug no:5
- Bug Description:
    Sort of similar to the first bug, but when I tried to print "hello" on the screen, there were dots ALL over the screen which looked nothing like the letters.   

- Ecpected Behavior: 
    The string being displayed norrmal and aligned within the space of the status bar. 

- Actual Bhavior: 
    Dots all over the screen (in the write text color) but did not resemble any of the charaters at all. 

-Fix: 
    The fix for this was quite simple, I did not keep the initaliziation of the mask within the for loops. So the value of the bask would never get reset for the next 
    characeter (line 630 in text.c). 

-Time: 15 mins    





./
6. Bug no:6
- Bug Description:
    After implementing my Octrees, I was not able to see the picture of my currents room 

- Ecpected Behavior: 
    Expected to see a clear picture of the game 

- Actual Bhavior: 
    I reveived a complete black screen with three dots of color.

-Fix: 
    failed to map properly back to the image , p->img[p->hdr.width * y + x]  (in photo.c )


7. Bug no:7
- Bug Description:
    My set_buttons was not working, buttons retrived the wrong value (in tuxt-ioctl.c) 

- Ecpected Behavior: 
    Expected buttons to print out the correct hex value when putting print statements in the functions

- Actual Bhavior: 
    recieved the wrong ( eg instead of ff, got an f7)

-Fix: 
    failed to switch the down and left correctly - was masking the bits incorrectly (0x20 and 0x40) in temp variables


8. Bug no: 8
- Bug Description:
    was not displayimg timer correctly 

- Ecpected Behavior: 
   timer should work as soon as the game starts 

- Actual Bhavior: 
    instead just paued at 00.00 , and froze 

-Fix: 
    did not or it with the mask_led that I calculated initially for displaying 3 0r 4 leds 



9. Bug no: 9
- Bug Description:
    leds kept flickering 

- Ecpected Behavior: 
   leds should be displayed properly with the correct values when testing it by hardcoding it any value 

- Actual Bhavior: 
    flickering leds, with half of the 7 segments displays turning on 

-Fix: 
    keps shifting the 4 bit vales(that indicate numbers to be displayed) and the decimal point for each number outside the for loop. Had to put that in the loop 
    for the values to keep iterating and going to the  next value 



10. Bug no: 10
- Bug Description:
    Picture was too pixelated with the color green 

- Ecpected Behavior: 
    Picture should be clear of yje current room 

- Actual Bhavior: 
    too many green pixels all over the screen and the picture was not even recognizable 

-Fix: 
    did not map it to the color palatte correctly. Had to add 192 to the index (128+64), but fogrot about the topmost 64 pixels so only added 128 to it


11. Bug no: 11
- Bug Description:
    The game was freezing up- dead lock  

- Ecpected Behavior: 
    Game should be working properly after synchronization

- Actual Bhavior: 
    game froze at the very beginning and no button pressed or typed was affecting it 

-Fix: 
    did not initialize my unsigned long cmd to 0 in get_tux_cmd, so the value was never being updated and kept returning CMD_NONE
